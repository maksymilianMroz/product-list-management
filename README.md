# Getting Started!

To see this project:

Clone project to your machine. \
In the project directory run: `yarn install`.\
and later: `yarn start`
(I cannot give this app 'live version' cause gh pages throw this away cause of http instead of https endpoints).

However, you can visit this page - [click](https://maksymilianmroz.github.io/product-list-management/). Except that you must allow 'insecure content' in your browser settings.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Some about this project:

- Done with React, Redux, JS
- You can add, remove and edit products on product list (everything is fetched from correct endpoints). 
- You can filter records, and sort items in columns. 
- Each item has got id, name, description, quantity, date and email.
- In this project is pagination, with few option of filter.

## Still to do:

- Tests
- Rewrite code to Typescript
